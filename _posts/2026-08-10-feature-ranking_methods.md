### Introduction

Vehicle development and validation involve the continuous acquisition of a large number of signals representing performance, thermal, electrical, and operating conditions. In a typical test campaign, approximately 1,500 recorded variables or labels may be available, making it difficult to determine which parameters have the greatest influence on a specific target response. To address this challenge, a feature-ranking methodology was developed to systematically identify and prioritize the variables most relevant to the target variable. The method evaluates the strength and consistency of each feature’s relationship with the target, while also considering redundancy, data quality, and potential nonlinear effects. Based on the resulting importance scores, the complete feature set is reduced to a focused list of approximately 50 to 100 high-impact or potentially influential variables. This prioritized list enables engineers to concentrate their analysis on the parameters most likely to affect vehicle behavior, thereby improving the efficiency and interpretability of the development process. Identifying these critical variables supports informed calibration decisions, accelerates root-cause investigation, and reduces the effort required to analyze large, complex datasets. Ultimately, the methodology provides a data-driven basis for calibrating vehicle systems to satisfy performance targets and thermal and electrical requirements while improving testing efficiency and overall development robustness.
